# odin-recipes
This current project is all about taking the very basic, but fundamental skills I learned to piece together a recipe website
This journey has been quite interesting, I've been at this for a little under two weeks and I am focusing on building a consistent habit of working on my skills for the same amount of time. Discipline will make or break this journey. Play the long game.
